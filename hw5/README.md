Part 1 

In this homework you will write a game called “minesweeper” that player is going to open cells
until the game will be terminated by “win” and returns the number of moves is made until win
when the player finds every “un-mined” cells or by “loose” when they hits a mine.
The player will choose a cell either to open or to flag it until the game is terminated. Every
time the player made a move the program should print whole grid with current moves, ask the
player their next move and get their choice.

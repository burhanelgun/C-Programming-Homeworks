Part	1	

In	this	part	you	will	deal	with	prime	numbers	and	Goldbach	conjecture.	Goldbach	conjecture	claims	that	every	even	integer	
that	is	greater	than	2	can	be	written	as	a	sum	of	two	prime	numbers.	You	will	implement	 isPrime function	that	checks	
whether	given	integer	is	a	prime	number	or	not	and	 goldbach 	function	which	takes	an	integer	and	returns	two	prime	
numbers	whose	sum	is	equal	to	given	integer.		



Part	2		

Write	a	function	that	dispenses	change.	Function	takes	8	parameters,	first	parameter	is	the	paid	amount,	second	parameter	
is	the	due	amount.	Rest	of	the	parameters	are	the	number	of	Turkish	lira	coins	that	should	be	returned	from	this	function.	
Parameters	are	sorted	in	descending	order.	Your	function	should	return	0	in	case	of	error,	1	otherwise.	



Part	3

In	the	last	part,	you’re	given	a	travelling	card	(IstanbulCard)	automation.	Every	member	has	a	balance(bakiye)	and	a	
remaining	monthly	use	(Aylık	kullanım	hakkı).	There	are	3	different	card	types:	Normal,	Student,	and	Teacher	cards.	Cards	
are	charged	with	different	amounts:	Normal	cards	are	charged	2.30₺,	student	cards	are	charged	1.15₺,	teacher	cards	are	
charged	1.65₺.	If	user	has	a	monthly	subscription,	you	should	decrease	it	by	1.	If	user	has	no	subscription,	you	should	
charge	user	according	to	his/her	card	type.	If	remaining	monthly	use	is	lower	than	1,	you	should	assume	that	user	does	not	
have	a	monthly	subscription.

Part 1 

In	this	homework,	you	will	continue	on	your	HW08.	You	will	manage	the	contacts	directory	as	you	did	before	but	you	will	
use	linked	list	to	hold	phone	record	for	each	person.	You	are	responsible	for	the	allocation	and	freeing	the	necessary	space	
for	phone	records.	 Do	not	keep	any	additional	space	for	phone	records. 	
	
You	are	also	asked	to	implement	serializer/deserializer	functions	for	the	People	struct.	You	need	to	create	a	binary	file	that	
contains	all	information	of	the	People	struct.	One	recommended	approach	is	to	store	name,	expenditure,	number	of	phone	
numbers	and	the	phone	numbers	for	a	person.

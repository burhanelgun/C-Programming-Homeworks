Part 2

Assume a C program that:
1. Reads a text from the user.
2. Changes all the alphabetical characters to lowercase and removes everything else than letters
(punctuation marks, numbers etc.)
3. Exits if the input line contains the word “end”. Otherwise continues to the first step.
4. Sort the words with respect to number of their occurrences.
